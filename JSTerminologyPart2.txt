1. Why is it important to write clean code?
    Teamwork support. Somebody else may work with that code so it's to ease that someboduy's job, but our's as well.
2. What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
    Comments are meant to explain the concise and detailed functionality and results of the code, 
    rather than making notes/messages to self or team
3. What is an array?
    An array is a special kind of variable type that can hold multiple values.
4. What are arrays useful for?
    It's usful to manage and manipulate data with ease.
5. How do you access an array element?
    by calling the array name and the element's index in square brackets like so: arrayName[indexNo];
6. How do you change an array element?
    You can just assign it another value, can replace it with splice function, delete it(pop), 
    move it whn altering the array by adding or removing other elements (using push, pop, shift, unshift)
7. What are some useful array properties?
    length, prototype, constructor
8. What are some useful array methods?
    toEtring(), includes(), foreach(), concat()
9. What are loops useful for?
    to iterate through the array's elements
10.What is the break statement?
    The break statement interupts the execution of the respective block of code/loop to jump to the next line of code after it.
11. What is the continue statement?
    Interupts the execution of the rest of the code in a loop to jump to the next iteration of the loop.
12.What is the DOM?
    Stands for Document Object Model and it represents the HTML webpage when loaded into web browser
13.How do you target the nodes you want to work with?
    With selectors
14.How do you create an element in the DOM?
    document.createElement(element)
15.How do you add an element to the DOM?
    parentNode.appendChild(childNode)
    parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode) 
16.How do you remove an element from the DOM?
    parentNode.removeChild(child)
17.How can you alter an element in the DOM?
    document.replaceChild(new, old)
18.When adding text to a DOM element, should you use textContent or innerHTML?
    textContent
19.Where should you include your JavaScript tag in your HTML file when workingwith DOM nodes?
    Inside the body of the HTML file
20.How do “events” and “listeners” work?
    Events are user interactions with the webpage, and specifie the behaviour of the HTML elements that the user interacted with
    Listeners are the detectors of certain specific user iteraction
21.What are three ways to use events in your code?
    Used as inline event handlers , event handler properties and as event listeners.
22.Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events?
    is allowing us to create multiple event handlers of the event for the same target.
23.What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners?
    For debugging and the ability to remove it with removeEventListener().
24.How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes?
    Get a nodelist of all of the items matching a specific selector with querySelectorAll('selector').
    Then iterate through the list to add listeners to each of them 
25.What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and querySelectorAll?
    The first returns a reference of the first match selector, while the second returns a nodelist 
26.What does a “nodelist” contain?
    Containis references to all of the matches of the selectors.
27.Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.
    In capturing the event trigger the event handlers of the parents of the target element first, 
    whilst in bubbling the event handlers of the target are runned first .
28.What is the difference between objects and arrays?
    objects have named indexes, while arrays have numbered indexes.
29.How do you access object properties?
    dot, square brackest property accessor and object destructuring
